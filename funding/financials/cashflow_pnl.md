## Notes for USDA  
- All projections are **conservative** (2% baseline) with **tiered bonus incentives** to ensure operational stability.  
- Higher returns (4–5%) are **possible as systems mature**, but are not used for baseline risk modeling.  
- Profits are **reinvested to add enterprise nodes**, creating additional **jobs and revenue streams** for the region.
