## 🌐 Mission
IsaKai Holdings builds AI for those who **value privacy, speed, and ownership**.

Isaiah took this mission headfirst after discovering how **centralized AI throttled his trading innovations**.  
Now, IsaKai scales **open, private AI tools** for everyone — **individual traders, businesses, and research teams**.

## 🖥 Hardware Backbone – *Phase 1 Build ($100K)*

- **8× NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48GB each)** – 384GB pooled via NVLink pairs  
- **AMD Threadripper Pro 7995WX (64 cores, 128 threads)**  
- **1TB DDR5 ECC RAM**  
- **64TB NVMe SSD (RAID10, 20GB/s throughput)**  
- **25Gbps Ethernet + Yggdrasil + WireGuard security layers (Firejail optional)**  
- **Chenbro/Supermicro 8-GPU chassis, dual 3000W PSUs**
- **LeoNTP Time Server 1200**
This system eliminates **$100K+/month in cloud costs** and supports **DeepSeek-V3 Q4, Mixtral 8x22B, WizardCoder33B, and Gemma3x12B** — all **run locally**.
